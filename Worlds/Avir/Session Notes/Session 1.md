The beginning
- Starting in the cargo hold of an airship (or train) on the way to Veylen

"The light rain quietly patters the streets of [[Veylen]], the stone roads creating tiny puddles that children splash in nearby, to the chagrin of a few parents. Despite the chill of the weather, the smell of fresh rain and your own warmth brings you comfort. The more frequent rains have brought bountiful harvests and plenty of food, even when the rare storm rages."
