World information: 
- There are 14 gods in total, 1 for each of the 7 sins (Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Envy, Wrath and Pride) and 1 for each of the 7 virtues (Chastity, Temperance, Charity, Diligence, Kindness, Patience, and Humility). In the past few decades, rainstorms have become more commonplace and more violent. War rages throughout the land, and peace has become unknown to most of the world. 
- What to think about when building characters: 
	- please come with a backstory! At the very least a few sentences, the more you write the more I have to work with, and thus the better i can craft a story for you. (please dont write a whole novel tho, i have plenty on my reading list already...). 
	- Also, include at least 1 city and NPC your character has attachments to, but feel free to add as many as you want. You guys will be level 3! 
	- (Stealing Shawnee's idea, also come with a "narrative wishlist", something that you want to see in the story. this can be anything, such as a carnival, a deep sea exploration, wilderness survival arc, etc. this is a collaborative storytelling game, so dont be shy! :D)
