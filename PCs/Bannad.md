f√∂rbannad is swedish for "cursed", and i just took the last part of the name. 

Bannad is a warlock, and has through sheer luck, persistence, idiocy, or all the above, has managed to form a pact with the god of godhood Ao. through this pact, Bannad is effectively immortal, and cannot be killed by normal means (but can bleed and/or be downed as normal). however, should a snail with a double spiral touch his skin, he will immediately die. because of this, Bannad has made it his goal to find and kill every double-spiraled snail. what he does not know, is that Ao has also made the only double-spiraled snail in existence immortal in the same way. 

So far, Bannad has yet to see any double-spiraled snail, but he does get nightmares involving snails.
