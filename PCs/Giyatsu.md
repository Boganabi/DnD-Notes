level 4: slow fall, quickened healing (action, spend 2 ki, roll martial arts die + prof, heal that much), weapon master feat (+1 dex, proficient in battleaxe, long-sword, war-hammer, and rapier)

  

Level 5: 2 attacks, stunning strike (when hit with melee, spend 1 ki point to attempt to stun, must succeed on Con save or be stunned until end of my next turn), focused aim (spend 1 to 3 ki to increase attack roll by 2 per ki)

  

Level 6: unarmed strikes count as magical damage

  

Level 7: Evasion: whenever I make a Dexterity saving throw that allows me to take half damage, if I succeed, I take no damage, and if I fail I take half damage. I can also spend an action to end an effect that is causing me to be charmed or frightened.

  

Level 8: Fey touched feat: You learn the Misty Step spell and one 1st-level spell (identify) of your choice. The 1st-level spell must be from the Divination or Enchantment school of magic. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either of these spells in this way, you can’t cast that spell in this way again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spells’ spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat (wisdom).

  

Misty step: Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. (bonus action, target: self, instantaneous, components: V)

  

Identify: 1 minute casting (can be ritual), touch, V, S, M, instantaneous.

You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.

If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it.

  

Level 9: You gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.

  

Personality trait: I sleep with my back to a wall or tree, with everything I own wrapped in a bundle in my arms

Ideal: Aspiration, I'm going to prove that I'm worthy of a better life

Bond: I owe a debt I can never repay to the person who took pity on me

Flaw: I'd rather kill someone in their sleep than fight fair

  

ki points left: 0/9

Ki save: 8 + prof + wis (15)

  

My gold: 6, 3 copper

Party gold: 57 gold, 4 silver

  

Elemental Attunement

You can use your action to briefly control elemental forces within 30 feet of you, causing one of the following effects of your choice:

  

- Create a harmless, instantaneous sensory effect related to air, earth, fire, or water such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, a spray of light mist, or a gentle rumbling of stone.
    
- Instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
    
- Chill or warm up to 1 pound of nonliving material for up to 1 hour.
    
- Cause earth, fire, water, or mist that can fit within a 1-foot cube to shape itself into a crude form you designate for 1 minute.
    

  
  

Water Whip: You can spend 2 ki points as an action to create a whip of water that shoves and pulls a creature to unbalance it. A creature that you can see that is within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d10 bludgeoning damage, plus an extra 1d10 bludgeoning damage for each additional ki point you spend, and you can either knock it prone or pull it up to 25 feet closer to you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and you don't pull it or knock it prone.

  

Shape the Flowing River: As an action, you can spend 1 ki point to choose an area of ice or water no larger than 30 feet on a side within 120 feet of you. You can change water to ice within the area and vice versa, and you can reshape ice in the area in any manner you choose. You can raise or lower the ice's elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can't exceed half the area's largest dimension. For example, if you affect a 30-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 15 feet high, raise or lower the square's elevation by up to 15 feet, dig a trench up to 15 feet deep, and so on. You can't shape the ice to trap or injure a creature in the area.
