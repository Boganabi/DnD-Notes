Vance is an anagram :p 

Vance is a young, aspiring wizard, almost always found deep in a new book or library, practicing and learning many spells. The few friends he has say that he is sometimes hard to get a hold of because of his obsession with learning. However, within a few years he had memorized every book in the library, and still craved more. He realized that there was no other way to learn more without leaving his books, so he turned to some light adventuring. He recorded all the knowledge he could, and with enough time he eventually amassed triple the knowledge available in the library he started in. The local adventuring guild began to favor him, as his knowledge became invaluable to the guild. He was soon able to afford his own tower to store all the books he had written and found on his adventures. 

Vance was always a thinker, and was constantly lost in thought, thinking of the future. He had already planned out an empire in his name, complete with plans to forge it. But the more he thought, the more sullen he became. Each new adventure he went on, the more bitter he became. He would talk about time with disgust, and his close friends would say that he is worried about death, of all things. Strange, as he was still almost 40 years away from retirement, much less death. 

After one adventure into the depths of hell, his condition changed suddenly. This was strange, as any other adventurer, even the more experienced ones, usually came back beaten and depressed, most never coming out of it. Vance had seemed to come back... happier. His friends say that he has become mad, talking about how magic has no limits, given enough knowledge. Sometimes he would speak of Orcus, a demon lord, as a close friend. The adventuring party he joined on the way to hell say that this started when he went missing from the party for a while, but came back unharmed, to their surprise. 

But Vance knew. Orcus held the secret to immortality, and soon Vance had greater visions than a simple empire. No, he would conquer death, and after that? Anything is possible. No, he was _unstoppable_. 

All in due time...

Looks something like this
