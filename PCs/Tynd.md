"Tynd" is Icelandic for "lost", specifically lost family 

Tynd is a man in his late 20's or early 30s. A fairly ordinary man, not much special about him. 

When Tynd was a young boy, he found a mysterious artifact in a chest of an abandoned house. He couldn't figure out how to use it, so he put it away and never thought much of it. Life went on. 

Years later, he now has a wife and has started a family. Suddenly, a force of evil beyond a common man's comprehension swept through the town with one target: his house. There was nothing he could do to stop it, and it was over before he could even realize it had started. The house was quiet, and he made the slow realization that his wife and kids are now gone, to who knows where. The last thing he saw was one of the evil creatures holding the artifact, and then everything was gone. 

He has sworn to find and bring justice to whatever was behind the disappearance of his family and the artifact.
