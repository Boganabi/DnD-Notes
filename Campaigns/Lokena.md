General plot: Before all this started, Satula, the essence of chaos, and Alutas, the essence of peace, were at constant battle. Satula eventually realized that if she could get enough power, she could destroy Alutas and cause even more chaos (by magically summoning more and more powerful monsters). Satula then used a little bit of her power to start a following, and as these followings grew, Satula grew more and more powerful, until she overcame Alutas. Alutas, in his last breath, shattered himself into many pieces, one of which is one player’s sword, which has always had Alutas’ name engraved on it. The only way to stop Satula from destroying the universe is by sealing her away using the power of Alutas’ pieces assembled into one, and the life force of the wielder. This can only occur when Satula is knocked unconscious. Otherwise, the sword tries to convince the wielder that the time is not ripe. Satula is currently destroying life as currently known, slowly moving through the universe. Kobuna tried to stop it by convincing people to join his forces, but they lost hope and withdrew. Kobuna then turned to conquering the universe to gain enough forces to stop Satula.

  

Kobuna: 20th level Wizard with access to 9th level spells (maybe 10th level?), has unlocked the secrets to immortality, and has devoted his life to trying to stop Satula. His wife, Kena, was killed by Kobuna in an attempt to give Satula too much life force to consume and therefore implode, but the life force of Kena was diverted to creating Tanya, Kena and Kobuna’s daughter. Kobuna hopes to find the essence of Kena, which is in a green orb similar to the orb that the king has, but radiates a lot more power [it is located in Nick’s castle, in a secret room]. He hopes to find this orb and feed it to Satula, in the hopes it would destroy her (This would not work, and it would destroy the entire universe). Because of fear from her father’s wrath, Tanya fled across Lokena, where she currently resides in Anek.

  

Tanya: 9th level Cleric (levels up as campaign moves along). As she escaped from Kobuna, Kobuna tried to stop her from escaping, but failed to do so, and as a result, Tanya lost some of her memory, and has no memory of Kobuna or Kena, until she meets Kobuna in real life.

  

The king (Nick): Commoner. Knows about the whole Satula/Alutas thing from Kobuna, and in an attempt to protect his kingdom from Satula did not tell anyone of her. His relationship with the whole battle for the universe is complicated. He is talking with Kobuna about how to defeat Satula, but at the moment Nick has procrastinated on joining. He found out from his mother, the queen before him (Vee) that Kobuna rules with an iron fist, and that under his rule Anek would suffer. However, he also knows that Kobuna also stands the best chance against Satula. Exactly 100 days after Nick became king, Kobuna gave Nick until the 1st of Onc, 4264 to make a decision on whether or not to join Kobuna.

What the players know before starting: You have always lived in the kingdom of Anek, with very little poverty to speak of, and inside its large, safe walls you have never seen a reason to leave. Nick, the king, has always treated his people fairly, with crime being a small problem, and the very little crime that does occur is usually swiftly taken care of. It’s pretty common to see the policing force playing games with citizens and dancing along to music that often breaks out in the streets. Sometimes, Nick himself would walk the streets, talking with his people and helping out once in a while. The entire kingdom is in good spirits, because the Festival of Life had just occurred two days ago.

  

Other things the players know: 

- The Festival of Life occurs once every year, at the beginning of the year.
    
- A year is 300 days, made up of 3 months, called Onc [pronounced like “honk” without the ‘h’], Deus [pronounced like “dew”], and Threng. Each month is 100 days.
    
- The current date is the 2nd of Onc, 4263. This means it has been 4263 years since the beginning of records, is the first month of the year, and is the second day of the month.
    
- Nick has been king for 13 years, with his first day as king being the 1st of Onc, 4250.  
    
- Nick also rules over three cities in his kingdom, called Un, Je, and Ko. The players start in Je.
    

- The mayor of Un is Greth
    
- The mayor of Je is Ven
    
- The mayor of Ko is Ben
    

- Un, Je, and Ko all have about the same quality of life.
    
- The castle of Anek is not located in any city, but rather sits in the center of the three cities, with Un being in the Northeast, Je in the South, and Ko in the Northwest.
    
- There is a wall surrounding Anek (in case it isn’t clear, Anek the kingdom encompasses Un, Je, and Ko), but nobody has ever gone past those walls in decades, possibly centuries. There has not been anyone who has come in through the walls either in that time either, although some records in the libraries of Anek have details about people who came from the outside, but the latest records of that happened in the year 3178.
    
- The planet Anek is on is called Lokena.
    

  

The game begins with the players in the town square of Je, which consists of a beautiful fountain in the middle, and the gentle cascade of water almost calms you, as you stand next to a board with various tasks written on it.**
