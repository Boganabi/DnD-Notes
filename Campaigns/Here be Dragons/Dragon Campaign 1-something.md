Introduction

- Intro scene:
    

- We begin with the party escorting the Zhentariam traders to Neverwinter. The 350 mile path to Neverwinter is calm, you can hear the distant waves crashing onto the Sword Coastline, and as you pass by Thornhold you can see its towers watching over the coast, keeping an ever watchful eye. The Mere of Dead Men is quiet and hilly, nothing but grass as far as you can see. The Sword Mountains rise up to the East, indicating that there is nothing but High Road for days. You continue up the High Road with the caravan, and as you come up on the Neverwinter Wood, you can see smoke plumes rising from where Helm’s Hold is. You hear some murmurs among the caravan saying that Helm’s Hold is always run down, so seeing smoke is probably normal. 
    
- Have each player roll a perception check, and describe this to players who rolled higher than 10:
    

- In the distance, coming from the smoky plumes of Helm’s Hold, you see a large flying figure rapidly flying in your direction. Then you hear it: the loud whooshing of huge wings.
    
- Players who rolled higher than 16 can see that it is an Adult White Dragon.
    

- Suddenly, some members of the caravan shout, “Everyone, hide the wagons! Find cover!” as people begin to hurriedly move their wagons to the side of the road and into the treeline, crouching down in order to stay hidden as children are hushed. What do you do?
    

- Characters who decide to stay in view are dragged to the treeline and bushes by other caravan members, with them shouting, “What are you doing?!?! Get down!”
    

- As you cower in the brush, everything goes silent. The whooshing grows louder and louder, almost unbearably loud, until a huge shadow comes over you like a cloudy day, then just as suddenly disappearing, the whooshing grows quieter and quieter, and goes silent. The caravan collectively relaxes, and then sets back up on the High Road and continues on, still shaken by the event.

- Characters are asked by the remaining Neverwinter Guard to investigate what happened at Helm’s Hold, since the rest have been sent to recover survivors.
