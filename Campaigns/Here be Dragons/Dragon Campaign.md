Main idea: 5 chromatic mystic dragons (1 of each color, called The Five) are attempting to seize power and control over the Sword Coast, attempting to become Dracoliches. Their campaign of terror has upset many ecosystems across the Coast, but they have gained the help of the Cult of Dragons. The Cult has a new head: Sammaster, once a mage, then a lich, and now a Dracolich, aided by Severin Silrajin

Player primer: The land of Faerun and the Sword Coast has been constantly plagued by the Dragon Cult, and they have never been stronger than now. Some say old powers are back, some say the new powers never left, and still others say the Cult is putting on a front while weak. One thing that is undeniable, however, is that there are more dragons in the sky than before…

The players start in Waterdeep, traveling North toward the city of Neverwinter. The trip protecting the caravan is normal, until they pass by Helm’s Hold. As they pass what used to be a small but bustling village, they see nothing but smoldering remains. The sky is covered in smoke, blocking out the sun and casting the surrounding area in darkness. Buildings reduced to rubble, bodies strewn in several places. A dragon flies off in the distance, its wings creating the all-too-familiar sound.
