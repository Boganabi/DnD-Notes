# Second Run
Current stage of Strahd: 1: Active interference [https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/8ts5bg/my_notes_on_running_strahd_like_an_unholy_terror/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/8ts5bg/my_notes_on_running_strahd_like_an_unholy_terror/)

	- Personality: kinda like Blackbeard the pirate
	- Possible boons: 
		- +5 to intimidation and persuasion
		- Magical cannons?
		- Magical chain whips?
	- Biggest fear:
		- Being forgotten. She wants to make a name for herself and be beloved and hated. As long as she isn’t forgotten
	- Biggest desire:

She never lets her guard down as it was always seen as a weakness no matter what environment she was in, and for that she has never came to terms with the loss of her family, her vengeance but also fear of vampires, loving ppl now in fear that she might lose them, etc. She forces the tough act so much that her soft side is buried but fragile as ever.
	- Biggest desire:
		- To achieve a position of security where she becomes the most respected and possibly has a faction of her own to run. One where she believes she would finally feel content and honor her liege name as it should be. Or at least, that’s what she perceives

[https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions#toc_12](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions#toc_12) 

DONT FORGET ABOUT IREENA OR INJURY CHECKS

Fae wants to steal? Strahd shows up, hidden, casts Hold Person, if that fails, greater invisibility, takes stuff back

Mouthy character to Strahd? Asks the mouthy one to step to the side (or other party members to step to the side), fireballs at high level, tosses enough revivify scrolls (or healing potions) to heal all but one character, says “tick tock,” then leaves.

Ezmerelda’s wagon has been moved to the Werewolve’s Den

Nightmare ideas:

(for when time is running short): in your dream, you see someone, you don’t know who, but they are sitting on a chair with their head laying on a table. Across the table, you see a singular candle, burning away. Above the candle is a rope, just barely above the candle, but close enough to burn from the candle. Your eyes follow the rope up to an anvil, hanging from the rope, above the person’s head, seemingly unaware of the danger present. 

Do you let the candle burn?

Yes: You stand frozen in this dream, unable to move, unable to react. Eventually, the candle burns through the rope, and it snaps. The anvil falls, and before it can make contact, the dream collapses around you.

No: You lunge forward toward this candle, quickly snuffing it out. As soon as the flame is extinguished, the dream is quickly plunged into darkness. Suddenly, a dark, crimson red eye appears, then another, then another, and another, until you are surrounded by these eyes, all trained on you. Then, you hear a deep, powerful laughter echo throughout the dream, slowly getting louder, overwhelming your senses, until it gets to a point where it is almost too much, and then just as suddenly, the dream ends.

In this dream, you find yourself under water, and even though this is just a dream, you can still feel yourself beginning to suffocate. Next to you, you see a ladder leading up to the surface of the water. Desperate to get to the surface, you grab onto the ladder and try to climb upward, but as fast as you climb, the ladder falls down, ultimately resulting in you going nowhere. You climb faster, but the ladder falls as fast. Eventually, you see the end of the ladder, and as it gets closer, you feel the need to breathe getting stronger and stronger, and you begin to lose hope as you reach the end of the ladder but get no closer to the surface. As you get to the end, you let go, and fall along with the ladder, slowly drifting to the bottom, and you find yourself unable to hold your breath any longer, you take a sharp breath in, suddenly awake.

(if another character dies without another character knowing): You find yourself in a dream with 4 other shadowy figures, 3 in front of you facing away, and another farther back, facing toward you. Next to the figure standing alone is a noose, slowly and steadily swinging back and forth hypnotically. The figure stands there, and despite that you cannot see his face, it seemingly stares directly at you. The rest of the figures wait patiently, and that is all you remember from your dreams.

You dream about an empty, broken room, debris scattered everywhere, nothing about its previous state is recognizable. The wind howls through the now broken windows, and you remember nothing else in your dreams.

Recap: Last week on Curse of Strahd, the party found themselves in an unfamiliar woods, but managed to get a hold of their surroundings and find a cave, saving Peak from several skeletons, and continuing on to find an old woman, who sells them Dream Pies. After some discussion with the old lady, the party continued to a nearby tavern. Inside the tavern, they meet Ismark Kolyanovich, who buys the party drinks. Ismark asked the party if they could escort his sister, Ireena, to Vallaki for 100 gold. Fae shows Ismark the letter, where it is revealed that it is not from the man whose signature is on the letter.

Recap week 3: Last week on Curse of Strahd, the party was guided by Ismark to his sister Ireena, who then asked if the party could attend his father’s funeral. At the funeral, they bury the burgomaster, but a mysterious figure appears. Horosha and Peak approach the figure, but before they get too close, it disappears. After the funeral, the priest, Donovich, asks the party if they can help his son, Doru, whose screams can be heard in the basement, but without killing him. The party, not knowing how to help without killing him, decide to continue on their mission to Vallaki, joined by Ireena. After a short journey, the party encounters the gallows, where the party sees a hanging commoner. Fae, however, sees herself hanging. The party continues on to destroy a druid and their twig blights, and then decided to investigate the light coming from the east. There, they find an encampment, where Madam Eva reads their fortunes, after some initial suspicion. Then, the party stays the night at the encampment, where Peak and Horosha proceed to absolutely shred some bangers. You all get a long rest, and now I hand it over to you.

Recap week 4: Last week on Curse of Strahd, the party gets a refreshing rest, and Drudonghar rejoins the party. The party continues on to a junction, where Horosha mysteriously gets a bout of fear of the eastern path. Moving West, the party is met by Count Strahd Von Zarovich, who makes a convoluted threat to the party to give them Ireena. For whatever reason, Strahd refers to Ireena as Tatiyana. After a short battle, Strahd laughs and then promptly leaves. Badly wounded, the party seeks shelter in the windmill, but are met with 2 green hags, which the party vanquishes after a tough battle. Toward the end of the battle, a third hag appears, and that is where we pick up today, after the hag destroys the doors. 

Recap week #5: Last week on Curse of Strahd, after conquering 2 green hags, the party tries to desperately escape a night hag. After failing to escape, the party then repeatedly attempted to restrain the hag, and after a long hard battle, the party eventually succeeded, saving 3 children in the process. You all get a long rest, and that is where I hand it over to you. What do you do?

Recap week #6: Last week on Curse of Strahd, the party continues on to encounter 3 dire wolves, this time overcoming the wolves. The party endures through the rest of the travel, eventually encountering the village of Vallaki. The party then splits up, one part going to the orphanage to drop off the children, where they find a demon-possessed Felix, which they overcome. The other part of the party goes to the town square, where they find a wooden platform with stocks and gallows, some people in the stocks. After visiting the orphanage, Ernst invites the party to Lady Fiona Wachter’s house, Peak and Fae uncomfortably familiar with leaving orphanages, but this time honorably rather than sneaking away. Horosha comes across his long lost brother, Izek, while making gold by playing his lute in the town square, accompanied by Echo. 

Recap week #7: Last week on Curse of Strahd, the party split up even further, with Drudonhar staying at the Wachterhaus and the rest of that part of the party going to the Blue Water Inn. Horosha and Echo are brought to the Burgomaster’s mansion, where Horosha is asked to see if he can find any evidence of Lady Fiona doing evil things. After meeting up at the Blue Water Inn, the party sleeps, and Fae receives a dream. In the morning, Fae is nowhere to be seen. The party continues back to the Wachterhaus, where Drudonghar is unsuccessfully trying to convince Little Kitty to go with him. After investigating around, some of the party finds a chest with bones in it and a somehow preserved body on Lady Wachter’s bed. When Peak finds out, she goes to confront the Lady, and after several denying statements, decides to attack her, quickly evaporating her. After a bit, some of the guards show up to the house, and we pick up today in initiative.

Recap week #8: Last week on Curse of Strahd, the party got away from the Wachterhaus without any punishment, and the house eventually burned to the ground, along with its secrets. After a quick meeting with Izek, the party decided to drop Ireena off at the church, but found out that the church is not as safe as they thought due to the bones missing. The party then goes on a chase to find where the bones lay, leading them to the Coffin Maker’s shop. There, the party finds several crates and the bones, but as Echo opens a crate, six vampires pop out, grab the bag of bones, and leave, almost killing Drudonghar and Rokc in the process. The vampires escape, and give the bag to Strahd, who promptly destroys the bones. Drudonghar attempts to cast spells on Strahd, but fails to do so. In the process, Drudonghar angers Strahd, and Strahd casts Blight on him, nearly killing him again. 

Recap week #9: Last week on Curse of Strahd, after a tense negotiation with Strahd that left Peak unconscious, the gang left Ireena at the church and set off in search of the man with the monkey, at the toy shop. With the town on edge after the vampire attack and tomorrow being the day of the Festival, the group finds themselves at the toy shop, unsettled by it’s accurate depictions of Strahd and Horosha. The toy shop manager suggests that the man they are looking for is at the Inn the party stays at, and they do indeed find him, where he interprets their card readings from Madam Eva.

Recap week #10: Last week on Curse of Strahd, the man with the monkey told the party about the missing child and the wine shortage, after which the party ventured north toward the lake, where they discovered a man on a boat attempting to sacrifice a young girl to the lake. Drudonghar attempts to save what he thinks is the bag of fish, and finds instead the girl the man was trying to sacrifice. The girl tells the party about her home village, where Drudonghar and Noggin visit in order to return the girl. There, the two are rewarded for saving the girl with various treasures and the Tome of Strahd. The next day, the village of Vallaki attends the Festival, where things go south quickly, and the Burgomaster, his wife, and the entire village are burned. The party escaped West, which is where we pick up today.

Recap week #11: After an unfortunate time in Vallaki, the party moves West, where the party meets a family that had their home, the only supplier of wine in Barovia, overrun by Forest Folk. The party agrees to help them out in exchange for shelter at any time, so the family led them farther West. At the house, the family warns them that it would be better if the party sneaks through rather than fighting, and warns them against using fire. While scouting out the area, the party discovers that Strahd is mysteriously watching them, but continues despite this. As the party continues to look for a staff, the party finds several blights and Forest Folk. We pick up today at the top of the round.

Recap week #12: After a long and hard battle between the party and the Forest Folk, the party eventually vanquished the army of blights by destroying the dark staff. As the army of blights collapses into a pile of twigs, the winery is safe once again, and with that, I turn it over to you. What do you do, as the family and Ireena wait outside, waiting for your return, as night sets in?

Recap week #13: After taking a long rest, the party woke up to the family working on the wine barrels, and then found out that the vineyard was missing a gem that is essential for the vineyard to grow. After a hearty breakfast, the party had a choice: find the witch Baba Lysaga and take the gem from her, or find Yester Hill and take the gem from the Forest Folk there. The party chose to face Lysaga, and now they are face to face with the witch herself. And that is where we pick up today, let’s roll initiative.

In the mists and shadows, betwixt the haunted trees,

The mother witch claims her bloodied prize,

The figure of death arrives to collect it’s fees,

And the devil of Barovia looks on from his castle rise

Recap week #14: Last week on Curse of Strahd: the party struggled through a long and hard battle against Baba Lysaga, but with a single line spell and a Cloudkill spell Lysaga took out 5 of the 7 members in the party, leaving only Echo to carry on. With the surrounding fog seeming to press ever closer, and the chilly air sending shivers throughout your body, Echo, what do you do?

Recap week #15: Last week on Curse of Strahd; the party reunited at the Winery, and decided to rescue the gem from Yester Hill. After meeting a new party member, Varis, the party took on a horde of druids and eventually destroyed the statue the druids were doing a ritual around. With the roar of battle settling down, and the druids running, you all notice a figure standing at the bottom of the hill towards the west. What do you do?

Recap week #16: Last week on Curse of Strahd; the party recovered the gem to the Winery after thoroughly testing for evilness in the gem. After not finding any, the party returned to the Winery, had a long rest, a hearty breakfast, and were on their way to Kresk to escort a wine shipment. On your way there, you encounter no monsters of any sorts, but you can’t escape the feeling of being watched. You look around to see who is watching you, but all you see are ravens cawing in the trees. 

Recap week #17: Last week on Curse of Strahd; the party successfully brought the wine shipment to Kresk, and were welcomed by the Burgomaster there, Dimitri. The party went straight to the Abbott, where they encountered strange human and animal hybrids, created by the Abbott himself. The party asked the Abbott about why he was doing this, and explained that he was attempting to create a wife for Strahd in the image of Tatyana. The party moved on to the village below, where Dimitri the Burgomaster offered to retrieve items for the party as thanks for delivering the wine, but the party found that not everything was alright with Dimitri. He revealed that sheep have been going missing, and that there may not be enough to make it through the winter. Luca, the sheep farmer, handed Varis a note, and that is where we pick up today. 

Recap week #18: The party kept watch over the sheep for the night, with Varis using his familiar to watch over the sheep. An unfortunate series of events led to the familiar perishing, and Varis waking up to an empty sheep pen, only a few bones with strange bite marks and blood left in the pen. After initially suspecting the Abbot, the party went up to the Abbey to search for clues. Finding none, the party went back to the village, where not much else was found. After another quick nap, a crowd began to gather around the pen to see what was happening. Anna, the Burgomaster’s wife, spoke to the crowd against Luca, who stood there overcome with sadness. The party then heard a scream, and as everyone except Brunt went to investigate, they saw a monstrous form of Ilya, the Burgomaster’s only son. Let’s start out today by rolling initiative.

Recap week #19: A long and hard battle against Ilya resulting in nearly killing Erzio and Navagon, but Ilya now lies dead at your feet. As the battle closes, the crowd approaches, with Dimitri standing at the front, in disbelief that his own son could be such a monster, seemingly in shock. Anna rushes to the front, toward Ilya. We pick up right there. 

Recap week #20: The aftermath of the Ilya battle left the town in shambles, with a dead burgomaster and no food for the winter, which is arriving quickly. After a quick dissection and interrogation session, the party found out that the Abbot was not responsible for the boy’s transformation. You all get a short rest, and that’s where we pick up today. 

Recap week #21: As the party leaves Kresk, they meet a new member, Thunk, as known by Peak, while simultaneously scaring off some wolves. Later on, they encounter Strahd himself, who gives Echo the Gambler’s Blade as a “victory gift.” Further, the party encounters another member, Vortiger, who already seems to know Strahd, and agrees to help them in their adventure. The party comes across a beautiful estate, and after being let in, meets Lady Fidatov, who gives Brunt a brief tour of her estate. As soon as the sun sets on the estate, suddenly, everyone inside falls dead from poison, and the house immediately falls into ruin. We pick up right there today…

Recap week #22: Last week on Curse of Strahd, the party explored the now decayed house, without finding very many items of value. Thunk found the body of Lady Fidatov, which seems to radiate a reality distorting magic about it. As Thunk touched it, the ghost of the Lady appeared and went out to the back, toward a hedge in the backyard of the estate. Later, Strahd appeared in the room as Thunk ventured into that room. Seeing the party, Strahd then threw Vortiger across the room in a fit of rage toward Votiger. This threw Peak and Vortiger into a rage, which could not stop Strahd convincing Varis to join him in his castle. As both Varis and Strahd have made their way off to Castle Ravenloft, we pick up there today.

Injury checks this session: Vortiger, Lorik x2, Peak, and Thunk

Recap week #23: Last we left off, the party took preparations to begin a 30 day training mission, but woke to find that the house had reset, and was no longer broken down and decayed. The party tried to convince Lady Fidatov that they were in a time loop, but accidentally activated a defense mechanism with mirrors in an attempt to get the Fidatov Family Crest. We pick up today in initiative, beginning with Vortiger if I recall correctly…

Recap week #24: Last week, the party finished off their clones, and proceeded to take the two crests on the wall. They then went to the hedge maze in the back, but only Thunk decided to go in. The rest of the party decided to long rest outside the maze, and in the morning, Thunk still has not shown up. Did anyone keep watch last night?

(also Thunk left a note in the maze that says “jet black with crimson red glinting eyes, danger”)

Recap week #23: Last week on Curse of Strahd, the party entered the Fidatov maze. It was not long before they discovered a protector of the maze: a hound with jet black fur and crimson red, glowing, glinting eyes, and much larger than a normal dog. Despite this, Brunt managed to find a spot to put one of the Fidatov crests, clicking perfectly into place. As the hunt continues, we pick up today in initiative at the top of the round.

Recap week #24: Last week, the party found the second fountain and inserted the second crest, unlocking the middle of the maze, at the cost of Navagon’s life. Perth, in an attempt to recover Navagon, also fell victim to the hound. As the rest of the party ventured into the building in the center, they encountered a ghost of Lady Fidatov, who promptly wailed and knocked Vortiger down. As Lady Fidatov’s ghost moves in to attack, you suddenly find yourself in an extravagant room, and you hear organ music fill your ears. You look over and see Strahd at an organ, playing dramatically. You stand before an extravagant table, with an equally extravagant chair at the end, with many chairs surrounding it, as if the chairs themselves were waiting. 

Looking around, you see your friends, Echo, Peak, Vortiger, Brunt, Navagon, Perth, Thunk, Erzio, Fae, Horosha, Forbannet, Drudunghar, Codrus, and Noggin. Around you, you see tall, extravagant windows, with stone walls stretching up to a vaulted ceiling. You hear footsteps approaching, and in walks 2 vampires: one you recognize to be Strahd himself, the other seems to be a servant of Strahd. Strahd walks to the end of the table and sits in the extravagant chair, and gestures at you all to sit and picks up a wine glass, already filled with wine. You all get the benefits of a long rest. Peak, you suddenly feel the effects of Feeblemind fade away. Strahd looks around the table at all of you, and says, “I’m glad you all could make it for my celebration dinner. As you may know, I have obtained my prize, my dear Tatiyana, and today marks the day we marry.” He then gestures to the vampire standing by the door, and says “Rahadin! Bring her in.” As Rahadin opens the door, you see Varis rush in, now with paler skin and blood red eyes, and whispers something to Strahd. You see the smirk on Strahd’s face fall, and his face contorts into anger. He slowly sets down his wine glass, and quick as lightning, grabs Varis by the neck and lifts him 2 feet off the ground. He shouts, “You… let her escape!? You have failed me, Varis, and I am afraid I cannot forgive you for that. I gave you new life, and now you have forfeited it.” Strahd then throws Varis on the ground, and you can see cracks form on the floor as you hear some of Varis’ bones crack on impact. Varis reaches up to Strahd, begging for mercy, but Strahd reaches out a hand toward him, and casts Disintegrate at 7th level. Varis promptly turns to dust as he lays on the floor. Strahd looks at Rahadin and says, “Rahadin, clean this up. The wedding is off. We should not have such a mess in front of our… honored guests.” As Rahadin leaves the room with the remains of Varis, Strahd walks toward a nearby window, and longingly looks out. A few seconds pass. Strahd then turns toward you all, and you can see in his red eyes an emotion you have never seen before: pain. In a strained voice, he continues: “Have you ever heard the story of Tantalus? He was punished to forever be just out of reach of fruit and water. When he reached up for fruit, it shrunk away. When he reached down for water, it drained away. After hundreds of years, I have grown to understand his pain. For hundreds of years, the curse put on me by Vampyr has prevented me from marrying my dear Tatiyana. I am done with this game.” Strahd then holds his hand out in front of him, and holds a dagger in his other hand. He presses the dagger against his hand, and shouts out, “Asmodeus, I accept your offer.” He then slices into his hand, and dark red blood drips out onto the floor. As his blood hits the floor, the area around you changes. The grayish haze outside the window turns a hellish red, and the mists surrounding the valley disappear, and you see hundreds, thousands, of Barovian souls, now freed from the mists, start funneling towards Castle Ravenloft, where you currently sit. What’s left is the space between planes of existence, a dark, screaming void. You cover your ears as the sounds get louder and louder, and eventually it stops. You find yourself in a different kind of Barovia, one that now has lava flowing instead of a river, and fire instead of trees. The table you were sitting at disappears, and the chair Strahd was sitting in morphs into a throne made of skulls. Before you stands Asmodeus, the lord of the layers of hell. He turns toward Strahd, and says in a deep, powerful voice: “Thank you, Strahd von Zarovich, for turning the souls of Barovia over to me. I will make myself at home.” You watch as Asmodeus places a hand on Strahd’s head, and then his body crumbles to dust, the last thing you see on Strahd’s face is not pain, but relief. In Asmodeus’ hand is now a glass ball, with Strahd’s soul inside. Asmodeus turns to the rest of you, and says, “Unfortunately, von Zarovich has turned your souls over to me. I hope you enjoy your stay in my new domain. And you, Peak, I have heard great things about you. Because of your willingness to fight and how far you have brought your party, I offer you a spot at my legion of generals”

(if peak accepts, her scales turn red, and horns grow out of her head. The rest of the party, not matter what they do, remain as the damned in Asmodeus’s domain.)

Initiatives:

NOTE FOR OLD BONEGRINDER: use 2 green hags and 1 night hag, Morgantha, the one who shows up later, is the night hag. 

Horosha is Izek’s long lost brother (rip)

The top: has 4 faces: happy, sad, wrathful, and dead.

Changes to Ilya battle: (needs to be CR 8-10, so AC is 16, 200 hit points, +7 to hit, DC for Retched Spittle is 15, STR is +1, and 3 attacks instead of 2)

As the party ventures to Kresk: if they stay there too long, Strahd and his minions attack the Winery. They find this out by seeing dead zombies, ravens, and some of the family member’s dead bodies scattered throughout the winery. Ireena is nowhere to be seen. The winery is also in ruins, barrels smashed, doors bashed in, windows shattered, empty. 

Varis (Devon’s new character) only remembers one thing of his past life, three words: “Going too far.” In his studies, he tried to unlock the secrets of life, much like Vecna, but he heard stories of Barovia, a land filled with undead creatures, ruled over by a now forgotten warlord. The stories he read say that the warlord had unlocked the secrets of life, and now is immortal. Varis decided to study this, he heard rumors of making deals with otherworldly patrons, and made a pact with one, becoming a warlock. After this, he became obsessed with unlocking the secrets to life, pushing away his wife, his son, and all of his friends. Eventually, he turned to darker, stronger magic. One day, he attempted to cast a spell to teleport himself directly to Barovia, but he did not understand that this was a demiplane, so the spell ended up killing him. However, the spell still teleported him to Barovia. Strahd, after finding out that a man had basically dedicated his life to getting to Barovia, admired his dedication, and gave him new life, becoming his new patron. 

What happened to his family: the spell that killed him left his room with charred remains. His wife, overcome with sadness, also took her own life. His son, now a husk of his former self with both his parents dead, left town to seek a new life. He was murdered by thieves on the way to his new town.

When Echo leaves Kresk: Strahd gives Echo the Gambler’s blade as a “victory gift”

Playing Strahd more aggressively:
- “So, you think you can go around disturbing the natural progress of things in MY domain? You have no idea what you are messing with. Let me enlighten you on what exactly you are dealing with.” Strahd will then proceed to throw a player character into a wall nearby (4d6 bludgeoning)
- Maybe he appears in the Mirror Room to do this, and adds on “Despite all the problems you may attempt to fix, you will always be your own worst enemy.”
- (To Peak) If you think you can take my land away from me, you will most certainly need your friends. Unfortunately, your friends are weak (casts Fireball at 7th level)
- If a player falls in battle, Strahd will paralyze the monster hurting them, then tell the characters that if they beg, he will let them go. No matter the outcome, Strahd will then let the monster finish them off.
  
Idea: Strahd disguises himself as Vasili von Holtz, a vampire hunter, then purposefully breaks a wheel on a wagon on the road. The wagon still has a horse with it, and has holy water and wooden stakes in it. "Strahd" then asks the party if they can find Ezmerelda north of Kresk. Should the players do so, when they bring her to Strahd, he then casts Disintegrate at 7th level (Prerolls: Ez on save: Nat 1, Damage: 90 (this disintegrates Ez)), drops the disguise, and thanks the party for helping him.

Idea: Strahd shows himself to the party, and asks how confident they are to defeat him. They will probably say they are confident they can defeat him, so he will then bring out a skull, and casts Speak With Dead on it. The party then hears the voice of Erzio, and Erzio talks about how Strahd is unkillable.

Changes to Strahd: AC 20, HP upped to 450, +7 to Athletics and +7 to Strength saves, “Stake to Heart” weakness does not work, his Multiattack is 3 strikes not 2, sword and claws have no difference. Charm ability is not there. (if in the future I decide to add it, nerf it a little, like by making the save every round or something.)

Idea: chest that says “dead goblin,” and when the players open it, a dead goblin is inside that reeks.

Bringing Codrus and Forbannet back (as vampire spawn): during the final Strahd fight, they appear next to Strahd, upon Forbannet dying, a d20 falls out of his pocket, and lands on 20.

Alternatively, they appear when the vampires attack Vallaki

Maybe include other passed PCs in the fight as vampire spawn?

Final Strahd fight: Strahd is CR 18, and there are 4 vampire spawn with him (this makes it a deadly encounter, change if necessary)
