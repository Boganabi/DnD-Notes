Some things to start with
- Can use a module as a jumping off point
- Other books
- Use any type of media to get ideas
- Ask your players what kind of game they want to play
- Oddly, Harry Potter is a good example of good worldbuilding
- The logistics is not great, but it’s a good example
- If your players are not putting thought into your characters
	- Try to trick them: they can have a magic item if they have a 1-page backstory that is of decent quality
	- Have a character creation session
	- Send them a questionnaire about their character

Things to keep in mind
- Your authorship has a beginning and end, your players drive the story
- If you use a module, you don’t need to stick with it, you can change it to match what you need
- A setting’s strength is not just its logistics
- If things are too logistical, it can weigh down your players
- Think macro elements
- Logistics is only something you should know, and you only use them to react to what your players do
- Your job is to marry the choices your players make and the reaction of the world
- Try to keep your voices diverse if you use them
- This will first and foremost create distinction, but also prevents classist or racist reflections on your world (i.e. not all bad guys should have a Russian accent)
  
General tips
- Create a narrative that you want to see
- Something you want in a narrative space that you don’t see anywhere else
- Come up with a strong theme and stick with it
	- Tackle philosophical ideas
		- Intrinsic evil in monsters
		- Relative morality
	- Warfare
		- The good and bad things that come out of it
	- Be creative with this! It can be whatever you want
	- There needs to be a core in your story for player enjoyment
	- It stems from your theme
- Organize around what vibe you want your players to have while playing
- You don’t need to know every single detail of your world
	- Trade routes and stuff are only important if you want hyper-realism
- Tone and mood are very important
	- If your world is grim, the things that take place in the world should also be grim
	- If your world is whimsical, the things that take place should also be whimsical
	- Do not mix those up, you need to stick with the theme

- Example
	- With a simple sentence of “this place sells a lot of iron”...
		- The place must be a heavy exporter
		- To export that much iron they must have a mine
		- With that much money there might be a lot of bandits around the outskirts
		- They could simply steal money
		- They could steal stuff to sell on the black market
		- They could be trying to control the market
- If your players don’t take any interest in a place or thing, don’t scrap it, reskin it and use it later when they might be interested in it
- Try to keep things to 2 pages maximum
- Prepare for your players to fuck everything up

Getting started with Worldbuilding
- Lay the groundwork
	- Basic outlines of the main points
	- Details come during the game!
- The beginning
	- How did your world come into existence?
	- Keeping it simples does not mean less unique
- Create your god/gods
	- How does divinity function?
	- Are they creators or just rulers?
	- How involved are they in moral affairs?
	- Are they benevolent, malevolent, or both?
	- Remember they are personifications of ideals
	- If you choose not to have gods, the most zealous of mortals will still affect the world as if they were gods
- Creating life
	- How did life begin in your world?
	- Which race or species dominates your world?
	- What does the world look like and how have people affected it?
- Creating the map
	- Does the world function like ours?
	- Usually, yes
	- Use map generators
- Creating monsters
	- What kind of wildlife does your world have?
	- How do they interact with humanoids?
	- How abundant are they?
	- How intelligent are they?
	- Are they destructive or necessary?
	- Native creatures defend their homes
	- Each pioneer has to wage war in order to settle
- Creating a simple history
	- How the world is shaped by conflict and progress
	- How common is war in your world?
	- How has each race affected your world?
	- Don’t concern yourself with dates
	- The longer a civilization exists, the more it will expand
- Mapping civilization
	- How progress expands
	- To simplify it, view expansion like water from the starting point, building will spread on the path of least resistance (i.e. hostile areas vs resources instead of gravity)
- Involving magic
	- How fantastical is your world?
	- How common is magic?
	- How accepted is magic?
	- How accessible is magic?
- Making the world feel real
	- Stay consistent
	- Avoid breaking your own rules
	- Write everything down during the game when it affects lore

The story
- Pick a theme to add cohesion
- Prioritize local worldbuilding over global worldbuilding
- Create a collection of flexible story arcs
- Leave easter eggs that lead to the endgame
- Gradually show that something bigger is at play
- Let the players drive the story towards the endgame

More tips
- Give your world a conflict
	- Instability
	- Threatens the status quo
	- Unfamiliarity
	- Can make weirder worlds
- Give your world a threat
	- Could be what caused instability
- Give your world a goal
	- Beware of accidentally railroading
	- Try to make it broad
- Causality (how your conflicts affect the world)
	- Always think about how the conflict affects places in your world

Stuck for ideas?
- Look at what you have access to
	- i.e. battlemap, minis, etc
- Pick a color!
- Google “myths and legends from {random country}” 
	- South of the equator is better!
- Choose an emotion you want them to feel!
	- Sadness
	- Depression
	- Horror
	- Fear
	- Disgust
	- Anything! 
- Take all of what you have chosen, and apply the emotion. 
	- Who has the chosen emotion? The monster? Someone it affects? Someone who would unleash the monster?
- Make these your theme!
