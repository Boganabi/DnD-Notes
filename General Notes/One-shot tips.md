Note: this is not specific to a one shot, this can be expanded to an entire campaign!
1. Assemble the player characters
	- Try to get a feeling for how each character is, and design your one-shot around it
	- Use a character creation meetup to help
	- Consider pre-made characters
2. Define the style
	- What kind of game do you and your players like? Is it a dungeon delve? Political intrigue? Puzzle solving? Mysteries? Something else? 
	- Make sure the style is clear to your players, and that they will have fun playing in it. 
3. Create a plot hook
	- This needs to be something quick, that the players can immediately latch onto
	- The meat of the story needs to grab them in an instance. Consider a strong, inciting incident:
	- As you are drinking in a tavern, one of the walls explodes into splinters as a massive and insane bull begins goring some of the customers with its horns. As the creature is slain, they discover a series of strange markings on the normally docile beast. They appear deliberate, arcane, and recent. Who could do this, and why?
	- During a celebration surrounding the maiden voyage of a major trade ship, an assassin attempts to slay a member of the party, as well as two other officials involved with the trade ship’s company. When the chaos dies down, a ring on the assassin’s hand holds the crest of a particular noble house.
4. Develop a climax
	- Needs to be thrilling and worth the toil in getting to it
	- Design a fun villain that fits the theme. 
		- If your climax is a monster hunt, think of an interesting and dangerous monster that could be responsible for your inciting incident, directly or indirectly.
		- If your villain is a mastermind, why did they do their dastardly deeds? What resources did they have at their disposal? Manpower, traps, weaponry?
		- A race against time? What unstoppable calamity/ungodly entity is barreling toward them, and what is the key to stop its arrival?
5. Flesh out key NPCs
	- These NPCs would contain information on the story and characters within it. 
	- List a few key tidbits of information they would know and can offer the party, via asking or paying. 
	- Consider giving them a few items that they could give the party to help them. 
	- Know where these NPCs could be found, but also keep in mind that they can be found in a better place in case the players do not go to a certain area. 
6. Prepare social encounters
	- Design encounters with NPCs of dubious intent. 
	- Free agents looking to use both sides of the struggle
	- Allow the players a chance to make an alliance, or enemy
	- Prepare some combat scenarios in case the situations go south. 
7. Player-tailored challenges
	- Design some challenges that are tailored to the player characters abilities
	- A charisma based character would want to lie or persuade their way deeper into the story.
	- A rogue or stealth based character would want to pick locks, find hidden traps, etc.
	- A strength-based character would want to do a feat of strength to save the day. 
8. Loot rewards
	- Come up with a list of loot or equipment the party can discover
	- Tailor it specifically to the story or come up with it on the fly
9. Outline key locations (Overall Sounds Smell Interesting)
	- These should be places where major story elements can occur to tie your inciting incident to the climax of the story. (see 3 and 4)
	- Give some sentences to set the scene with each locale, underlying their importance
	- Consider having some backup locales that aren’t strictly necessary to enable players to explore easier. 
10. Avoid a wandering intro
	- Try to avoid a “you are all strangers and meet in a tavern”, it’s time consuming
	- Try to have ways where they already know each other
	- Could be a band of adventurers
	- If they have to be strangers, consider a way to have them all drawn together definitely and forced to become allies very quickly
	- Could be summoned by a mysterious being, each selected for an unknown purpose
11. Keep it moving!!!!
	- If the players seem to lull or become confused, try your best to keep the story moving
	- Maybe move the appearance of an NPC sooner than expected to help nudge the group forward, or they discover another clue that further points in the direction of the next story point
	- Even atmospheric tension can help keep it moving, like a growing thunder coming from a mysterious arcane storm
12. Extra credit: prepare some character epilogues! For each character, prepare some fun and short epilogues that describe a victorious sunset or vicious death.
