## Worlds Created
- [[Avir]]

__Notes__

The world needs a conflict of some kind
- Familiar vs unfamiliar
- Example of unfamiliar is a world which stopped spinning
Next, we need a threat that is involved in the conflict 
- If the conflict is instability, the villain could be the cause of instability
Specifically D&D tips
- The world needs a quest to follow
	- Don’t overcomplicate it, or it becomes railroady
	- Consider not thinking about what the goal is to encourage rumors and theories
- Start with nations
	- Consider how morals/laws would change with the conflict
	- Consider the different ways these nations would survive the conflict
- Races
	- Consider with causality how different cultures would form with each race
