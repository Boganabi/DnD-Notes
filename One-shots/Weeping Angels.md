Weeping Angels One-Shot

What to give your players before you begin

This is a level 10 one shot, designed for 4-5 players. The theme surrounding this adventure is mystery, with minor scares.   

A close friend of yours, Bren, went out to drink late last night. You were the only ones who knew he was going out, and you know he said he would be back before sunrise. He is not the type to disappear like that, so as you wake up this summer morning, you gather your friends in the town square in the search for Bren. 

Description of Bren:
- Race: Gnome
- Height: 3ft 8in
- Hair: Brown, with streaks of white
- Age: 16
- Eyes: Blue
- Last seen wearing overalls and a blue striped shirt with a yellow hat.

Background on Weeping Angels

These monsters are based on the ones from Doctor Who. The main thing about them is that they only move when not observed, and they move fast. So how would this work in D&D? Well, there are a few ways to do it, and it comes down to you, the DM, to decide which way to use. 

You could:

1) Use a sort of cone-shaped sight mechanic to keep track of where your players are looking at any given time. 

2) At the end of every round, the Angels use their reaction to make their move, as like a sort of thing where your players “blink”

3) If your players want to avoid blinking, they need to make a CON save after 2 rounds of not blinking, with the DC increasing each round, starting at 10 and increasing by 2 each round. (For example, round 3 of not blinking is DC 10, round 4 is DC 12, round 5 is DC 14, etc. If they fail the DC by 6 or more, the character is blinded for the round, and if they fail by less than 6, then the character blinks, giving the Angels a potential chance to move. 

4) Right before the Angel’s turn, have everyone that could be looking at the Angel make a CON saving throw. Add up everyone’s total, and if it is below 12*(number of players), the Angel will move during the collective blink. Otherwise, the Angel is in statue form. If the character is making an active effort to avoid blinking, then combine this method with method 3 to increase the difficulty of the save each round. 


Whichever method you decide to use, remember to communicate that with your players. My personal method for this would be to use a combination of 1 and 3 or just 4. 

The next thing to decide is whether or not to give the Angels a speed or just have them move wherever they want when not observed. If you decide to have them teleport anywhere, remember that they cannot move through walls and must stay out of the observation area. If you decide to use a movement speed, then I recommend giving them a very high movement speed, such as 60 or 80, even as high as around 100. 

As an additional note, if you want to give your players more challenges (or just annoy them), when the Angel hits them you may choose to have them make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be teleported back in time to before the character entered the room where the Angel is. Memories remain unmodified.

Places to visit in the town that your players might be interested in

The bar/tavern

- The local tavern is owned and operated by a man named Angel. He is basically in love with his tavern, he is always perfecting his drinks, from water to the strongest ale. His dishes are always sparkly clean, and he always knows what’s going on in the town from conversations he hears between the town’s citizens. His whole life is his tavern. 
- The last time he saw Bren was around 1 in the morning last night, leaving the tavern. He was going on about some strange mystery about a crypt of some sort. There were still some people left in the tavern then, since it doesn’t close until 2, but the few people left were pretty drunk and most likely don’t remember anything. They are upstairs in the rooms, but it’s unlikely that they will have any information. 
- None of the people upstairs know anything about the whereabouts of Bren, they were all too drunk to remember anything.

Bren’s house

- As you approach Bren’s house, you notice that one of the windows is cracked open. The window is opened far enough where you can easily fit through.
- As you enter his house, your feet step quietly across the wooden floorboards. The house is deathly quiet, with only the quiet drone of the outside noises to drown out the silence. Bren’s house is pretty neatly kept, with the exception of his room. There appears to be no sign of battle or struggle anywhere. In his room, you see documents scattered everywhere. 
- An Investigation check of DC 10 reveals that one of these documents is a map of the town, with a red circle around a spot about a mile West outside of town, and Bren seems to have labeled it “crypt.” Some notes scattered across other documents in the margins seem to be regarding missing people in the years past. Bren seems to have connected it to the crypt he circled. Most of the information regarding the missing people has been lost to time, as the documents seem to be at least hundreds of years old. Most of the words are unintelligible, as the ink is much too faded. 

The crypt

- As you approach the entrance, the smell of it hits you before you can even see it. The stench of overgrown moss and untampered wilderness hits your senses, almost knocking you back. As you look into the entrance, you can see the tunnel leads down into complete darkness, you will need either darkvision or a light source to see. Footsteps on the ground lead into the crypt, and a DC 15 Survival check tells the character that these footsteps are fresh enough to be Bren’s. 
- As you descend into the darkness, if you do not have darkvision or a light source, you are now blinded. Those of you that can see, the tunnel descends, twists and turns multiple times, and after walking for around 10 minutes, you feel the air around you is much chillier than the outside summer air, and you feel even your bones turn cold. 
- As you continue, your feet create pattering noises as the air grows ever colder, and at this point it’s hard to imagine that above you the earth is teeming with life in the summer heat. The only sounds you hear are your own, echoing against the walls of the crypt.  

The final encounter

For this fight, if you have 4-5 players, use 2 Weeping Angels, and if you have 6 then use 3.

- Suddenly, the tunnel opens up into a larger cavern. Marble statues adorn the center path to a tomb in the far center of the room, each silently watching you. You get the unsettling feeling that some of these statues are watching you. (Bren is in the tomb, he slept in it for the night and got trapped under the lid. When the players uncover the lid, he is unconscious and has turned a little blue from the cold, but otherwise fine)

You may randomly determine which statues are the Angels, or you may just decide that the statues on the side are the Angels.

When the players approach the tomb, the doors behind the slam shut, and the 2 characters that stayed the farthest back are attacked by the Angels using hit-and-run tactics. The Angels run back to where they were as statues after attacking. That was the surprise round, and after that, have them roll initiative.
