Wendigo One Shot

Primer
- This is designed for beginners at level 1, and has themes of horror and cannibalism
- “The small rural village you stopped in for the night during your travels seems to be desperate to hold on to its dwindling population…”
Overview
- The players stop for the night in a comfortable tavern, but are awoken abruptly by a blood curdling scream coming from the forest’s edge. Upon inspection, the party sees a dead mercenary surrounded by curious villagers, none daring to get close to the body. The mercenary has a large chunk taken out of its side, and on closer inspection seems to have been half eaten by something with human teeth. The villagers ask the party for help, since the villagers recognize the mercenary as one of the 5 they sent out to search for some missing villagers. The party is asked to track the footprints leading away from the body, a mix of hoofprints and what appears to be a large chicken footprint. Following these tracks, the party comes across various things, and as the afternoon comes to a close, another mercenary, dressed similarly to the other one they saw and in a similar state. Continuing down the trail, the party begins to notice the lack of any wildlife sounds, and the wretched stench of long dead bodies. In the fading light, the party sees more bodies as the stench grows, including the body of the hunter and druid. In the distance, they hear the hunter say something, along with the druid. Suddenly, as the sun disappears and the moon provides the only light, when the stench becomes almost too powerful, they hear the powerful shriek of an elk, which slowly becomes a guttural roar. The call of the Wendigo.
Introduction
- “Guided by the moonlight, you collectively stumble out of the dark forest, the shrubbery and leaves almost grasping at you as they crunch under your boots. Brushing the loose leaves off your shoulder, you breathe in the cool night air, and you can smell a crisp winter on the way. Taking in your surroundings with the forest now behind you, and the sun well below the horizon, you see a small, dark farming village below you, faintly illuminated by the welcoming glow of a single tavern light.”
- Any other homes inspected are locked for the night, no sounds coming from within, and knocks/calls go unanswered
- When players enter the tavern:
	- The warmth of the tavern wraps around you as you step into it through the worn wooden doors. The old floorboards quietly creak beneath your feet, as the smell of fresh pastries fills your nose. An old woman with thin gray hair, kind eyes, and a green flowery apron looks up at you from her paperwork as you enter and greets you, saying “Oh, come in! Come in! It’s freezing out there! How can I help you youngsters?”
	- Suki (the old lady) gestures to a table with some chairs around it, and offers the party food and drinks, making conversation as she works.
	- The old lady introduces herself as “Suki,” and asks the party if they are the adventurers sent from the request the village mailed out 2 months ago. 
	- If asked about the request, Suki says that they've had villagers go missing sporadically for the past few months. They sent out mercenaries to search a few weeks ago, but they never returned.
- In the morning, the party is awoken by a bloodcurdling scream coming from the edge of the forest.
Plot hook
- The scream leads the party to a small gathering of villagers around a body near the forest’s edge. The scream came from a villager who came across the body as the sun was coming up.
- The body has mercenary’s clothes on it, and seems to have a huge chunk taken out of its side. 
	- “Groggily, you grab your bags and hurriedly find the place where the scream emanated from. Your boots scrape against the dirt as you make your way to the forest’s edge, and the smell of morning dew fills your nose as you scan for the source of the sound. Your eyes catch a small group of villagers near the treeline, and as you approach a new smell assaults you; the smell of death. Pushing through the smell, you see what caused the scream: a dead body lying on the edge of the forest, almost hidden in the canopy of leaves. The villagers nearby seem to be frightened and nervous, asking amongst themselves if they are next. Most turn away shortly after their arrival, unable to face the horror before them. What does your character do?”
- Have everyone roll a perception check, and on an 8 or higher:
	- “You notice that with the attire the body has, such as the clothes and gear it has, this person was a mercenary, and mysteriously really skinny for someone in that career. You can see some of the bone pressing up against the skin, and their face is gaunt.”
- Anyone wanting to discern how long it was since this person has eaten can roll a survival check, and on a 10 or higher:
	- “It seems, judging by the visible ribs, elbows, and knuckles, that this person seemingly hadn’t eaten in days.”
- On a 12 or higher (or if they inspect closer):
	- “You notice something else about the body, or rather, something missing. You peer into the shade created by the leaves, partially hiding the body. You notice that where the arm should be, is nothing. You follow where you expect the arm to be to their shoulder, where again, the body lacks. Horrifyingly, you realize that half of the torso is missing as well, and a trail of blood leads into the forest. Looking closer at the wound, you see that there are bite marks, indicating that something was attempting to eat the mercenary. Something with… human teeth.”
- After discovery of the body, have them roll a survival check. On a 10 or above:
	- “Beside the body, you find tracks interwoven with blood, seemingly trailing from the body. The tracks are a mix between what appears to be hooves and large, thin human hands, evenly spaced between each other.”
	- Checks higher than 14 discern that these tracks were made by a single animal, based on the pattern of the footprints.
- Noting the character’s curiosity of the body, they offer to pay the party to find what killed the mercenary, as they think it might lead to the source of their disappearing population.
- If the players follow the tracks:
	- At the end of the day, they come across the location of the Wendigo
	- Have them periodically roll survival checks to make sure they stay on the trail (should be 1 or 2 checks total, DC 10)
- If the players do not follow the tracks:
	- The Wendigo finds them as they camp for the night.
	- Throughout these encounters, remind the players that they have an unshakeable feeling that they are being watched.
	- As time goes on, the watchful eyes they feel start to feel less like curiosity and more malicious…

Woodland encounters: (feel free to use this: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jYZZnRBT0eOv1KG-Cza5651jDw5U8vIG/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jYZZnRBT0eOv1KG-Cza5651jDw5U8vIG/view). I like this too [https://www.dndbeyond.com/forums/dungeons-dragons-discussion/dungeon-masters-only/26392-a-d100-non-combat-random-encounter-table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/forums/dungeons-dragons-discussion/dungeon-masters-only/26392-a-d100-non-combat-random-encounter-table)) I did these in order, but that isn’t necessary.
- “You make your way through the forest, pushing past branches and stepping over logs. Birdsong floats through the cool air, and sunlight trickles through the trees, reflecting off the morning dew. Twigs and small branches crack underneath your feet, occasionally startling small animals nearby. The smell of morning dew eventually fades, and is replaced by the scent of moss and shrubbery.”
	- If they are following the tracks, add: “Whatever made these tracks, clearly knew their way around the forest, and nimbly made its way over all these obstacles. On the trees, you can see small scratch marks along the trail”
- “In the distance, the sound of a rushing river graces your ears. As you continue, the rushing water grows louder and louder, and you finally break through the treeline to see the river itself. The smell of moss is strong here, and the air feels moist. However, as you take in the scene around you, you notice that the river is too deep and too fast to wade through. You look to each side, in a vain attempt to see a path around the river, but to no avail, as it extends as far as you can see in each direction. How do you attempt to cross?”
	- The river is 20 feet wide, and about 10 feet deep. 
	- Characters attempting to swim across must make a DC 13 Athletics check or be helplessly swept 15 feet down the river each turn. 
- “You hear a branch snap nearby, interrupting your meandering thoughts. What do you do?”
	- The source is simply a friendly explorer, engrossed in the surrounding nature. If the characters hide, he doesn’t notice them, and continues on his way, whistling as he goes. 
	- If the players don’t hide, he greets them, and asks them what brings them to these woods. If asked, he says he’s just exploring, getting in touch with nature. 
	- “Appearing out of the treeline, is a dwarf dressed in loose clothing and a yellow straw hat. He has long, gray hair and an unkempt gray beard. He looks around, wonder in his eyes, up at the treeline. He takes a deep, relaxing breath, wipes some leaves off his dirty red shirt, and continues.”
- “Continuing on into the afternoon, the forest begins to change. You start to see more and more vines hanging from the trees, and the trees become slightly more stout. The air grows thicker and mustier, and your boots start to sink the mud more. The cacophony of frogs fills the air, the smell of earth hangs in your surroundings.”
- “As the sun hovers over the horizon, threatening the darkness of night, you see off in the distance a small, flat clearing with a mound of dirt in the middle. Surrounding it, you see dozens of life-like statues, each in some stage of fear. Most have their hands up, in a feeble attempt to block something. A few surround the outside, around 3 of them, each with wings. These statues don’t appear to be locked in a state of fear. In the fading afternoon light, the shadows extend far from the lonely statues, reaching for any signs of company.”
	- If a player inspects the clearing: “As you enter the clearing, you notice that the normal sounds of nature have drawn silent. Pushing on, you also notice that the mound of dirt in the center seems to be almost… moving? The mound seems to be breathing, as if the earth itself were alive. Stepping closer, you realize that you are seeing something that is very much alive, but thankfully asleep. Beneath the thin layer of earth, you see blue scales, slowly rising and falling as the creature breathes.”
	- The sleeping creature is a Basilisk. The Basilisk does not wake unless attacked. The statues around it are victims of the Basilisk, except for the winged statues.
- As the players leave the area: “Continuing on past the clearing, with the sounds of nature returning to your ears, your curiosity causes you to glance back. Glancing at the statues, you realize that where there had been 3 winged statues, there are now only 2.”
	- The missing statue was a Weeping Angel, although the Angel does not attack the party, and simply escapes. It leaves no footprints. 
- “With the sunlight fading into night, your eyes adjust to the new light level. The sound of birds is replaced with the song of crickets and the howling of wolves in the distance. Suddenly, in the middle of the trail, you see a man buried up to their head, with the ground nearby seemingly undisturbed. When you draw near, he says, ‘Oh, finally! Someone that can help! I was worried I was going to die here!’”
	- When the party gets closer, or goes to help him: “As you draw nearer, his head pops up out of the ground onto 8 hairy spider legs, each making clicking noises on the ground. The head cackles, as it scurries off into the surrounding shrubbery and disappears.”
- “In the darkness of night now, you begin to hear chanting in the distance. As you continue, the chanting becomes louder, and you begin to notice torchlight as well. The smell of something burning wafts through the air. Suddenly, you see the source of the commotion: a group of women surrounding a torchlight, chanting into the night.”
	- If the players don’t sneak or try to hide, the women notice them, and they simultaneously say “Found!” in a panicked voice, and they quickly extinguish the torchlight. Soon, they disappear into the night. 
- “Not long after, you see something hanging from a tree over the trail you are following. As you approach, the figure appears to be humanoid, hanging upside down from the tree. Getting closer, the foul scent indicates that whatever it is has been dead for hours. Suddenly, you realize that the figure is wearing a familiar dirty red shirt. Looking around, you see the familiar yellow straw hat lying nearby, next to the pool of blood descending from the remains. The body is nearly unrecognizable, claw marks and chunks taken out of it, with familiar bite marks, make the scene hard to look at. A haunting wind howls through the trees, turning the body around, and as it does so, its face shows a gruesome sight. Whatever got a hold of him bit off his face down to the bone, leaving a bloody skull in place of his face.”
The Wendigo encounter
- If the players are following the tracks:
	- “Following these tracks, and guided by the moonlight, you start to notice the foul stench of death. At first, you are able to ignore the stench, but as you continue, the smell becomes overwhelming. Then, you begin to notice that the pleasant sounds of nature that surrounded you before are replaced by silence. The moonlight filtering through the trees faintly illuminates the source of the smell: dozens, hundreds of bodies, scattered around. You can see ahead of you a clearing, where more of these bodies lay around. Each of the bodies are infested with flies and maggots, but they all share a similar atrocity. All of the corpses are covered in the same bite marks as the first two you saw, and all of them are partially consumed. Some are torn to pieces. Suddenly, the silence is shattered. From the middle of the clearing, you hear the cry of an elk emanate from its center.” 
- If the players are not following the tracks:
	- “Ahead, you see a clearing. A nice place to rest and make camp for the night! You begin to set up camp, but then slowly realize that the sounds of nature that normally surround you are gone, replaced by silence. The silence is suddenly shattered by the piercing cry of an elk, near the tree line.”
- Either way, after reading the above, read this:
	- The cry then grows deeper, and deeper, and slowly becomes a guttural roar, sending vibrations through your body. Then, you hear the voice of the dwarf you saw hanging from a tree not long ago: ‘No need to fear, come closer!’ As this familiar voice rings in your ears, you see something begin to move near where the sound emanated from. Suddenly, the figure appears in your sight. The legs of this creature are that of a donkey, covered in fur and ending in hooves. Its torso is skeletal thin, as if the creature had not eaten in months, its skin falling off its body to reveal the ribs beneath. Its unnaturally long, thin arms end in large, boney, human hands. Its head is similar to an elk, but consists of only a skull, its eyeless sockets still managing to feel like those of a successful predator. Huge antlers extend from its skull, and human arms extend like mandibles from its mouth. The creature’s mouth widens into a smile, the smile of a devil you didn’t believe in, revealing rows of bloody, human teeth. Exuding from the creature’s mouth, it says in the dwarf’s voice again, ‘It appears you are lost.’ The Wendigo then begins to slowly approach you.”
