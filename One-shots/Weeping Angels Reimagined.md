Introduction/Player Primer
- Option 1:
	- The characters all received a letter in the mail, calling any and all able-bodied adventurers to help the local mercenaries with clearing out a basilisk’s lair. 
	- The letter reads:
		- Any and all able-bodied persons requested. Basilisk lair needs clearing out. Preferred to bring a mirror or Greater Restoration spell. If unavailable to you, will be provided. Upon completion, reward of 2000 gp each. 
- Option 2:
	- A bunch of Kobolds are unleashed upon a quiet town, most screaming, “STATUE MONSTER! STATUE MONSTER!” The players are tasked with finding out where the kobolds came from and why they left.
