### Background

You have been hired as a thief to steal documents that, if leaked, could start a massive war between two very powerful countries (Ruska and Huma). The documents can be identified with a large title reading “Classified: Vote Count.” It contains a vote in the Ruska Senate regarding confidence in Huma, and if anyone in Huma got a hold of it, it would begin an all-out world-ending war. One famous journalist has got his hands on them, and is at risk of leaking them. The man responsible, who currently has a hold of these documents, is named Elcius Windmaster. He is throwing a wild party at his estate tonight, with many high class people in attendance.

Your task is to infiltrate the party, steal back the documents, and leave the party without anyone noticing you. NO BLOODSHED. If anyone in attendance at this party gets hurt, or goes missing, it will be all over the news the next day. If that happens, Elcius will be investigated, and the fact that he stole documents would get leaked from the investigation, causing an already unstable relationship between Ruska and Huma to collapse. You will have an earpiece to help guide you where necessary, connected to HQ.


Introducing the game

As you approach your destination in the carriage, you can see a line has already formed to get into the party, which is already in full swing. The driver then urges you outside the carriage, as you find yourselves at the back of the line with the sun setting on the horizon. 

(Ask if the characters would like to do anything, and adapt as necessary)

As you reach the doorman, he holds his hand out for your invitations (assuming they give them to him), and he takes it in his white-gloved hand. He looks over them for a second, then puts the invitations in his pocket, then moves to the side to let you in. “Enjoy yourselves tonight,” he says politely as you enter the large manor.

Description of the manor

As you come through the large maple doors of this elegant manor, the din of the ongoing party greets your ears: glasses clinking, champagne being poured, and general conversation. The grand entrance hall features six large pillars stretching up to the ceiling, with a long hallway leading to the back of the manor. There are a few people in the entrance hall, but the main concentration of people is in the main hall. Looking over at the people in the main hall, the first person to catch your eye is Elcius himself, since he seems to have drawn a crowd around him. There are a few other groups around the area, however, discussing and sharing stories on their own. As your dress shoes click against the black and white tile floor, you also notice the extravagant bathing pool to your left, with a few drunk people occupying it, relaxing and mingling. When you reach the main hall, you notice in the ceiling massive glass skylights, filtering in the fading light, creating spotlights around Elcius and the crowd around him. As you adjust to the hectic atmosphere, the smell of champagne fills your nose, wafting from the many doors around the mansion. You hear in your earpiece, “You’re welcome for bribing the butler to let you keep your weapons. The documents are in the treasure room, and should be in a drawer. Typically journalists don’t care too much about documents they get, so it should be pretty easy finding it. You will need to blend in and mingle a bit so you don’t seem suspicious, so go have fun, and don’t get too drunk. Good luck.” What would you like to do?


Some NPCs to start with

Consider giving these guys more depth? Have some sort of subplot to them, or include them in events possibly?

Elcius Windmaster: Clearly the center of attention in the center of the room, you see a tall, handsome, and well-dressed half-elf. He has striking blue and green eyes, smooth pale skin, and shiny black and slicked-back hair, with a shiny white-toothed smile and sharp-tipped ears. His jawline is sharper than a knife, and you can almost make out his muscles beneath his magnificent and well-fitting suit. He wears expensive golden and silver rings on his hands, shiny black dress shoes, and is holding a wine glass half-filled with white wine. Two women with bright red lipstick, sparkly red dresses, dark black eyeshadow, and shiny black high heels are elegantly latched onto each of his elbows, each holding their own glass of wine. One has long, curly brown hair, and the other with luscious blonde hair, both with large and shiny diamond rings. 

Elcius is very charismatic, always seeming to be the center of attention of everyone at the party, both men and women have lust in their eyes as they behold him. You can hear his voice across the drone of the party, smoother than silk, and rich as dark chocolate. The women at his side notice you, eye you up and down, and a smirk forms across their faces, seemingly forming ideas in their heads. They give you a sly wink, and join back in the conversation with Elcius and his friends.

When the players listen in to what he is saying to the group around him, they hear him talking about the controversial topics that are currently being voted on in the senate, such as whether to establish a draft or not. Other topic ideas: discussing if nuclear energy is the future or not, if coal/fossil fuel harms the environment, and if global warming is real or not.

Danore Nallithe: Standing in the corner of the room, seeming to be too nervous to step out into the main crowded area, you see a young half-elf. Short and stubby, he has black curly hair and eyes the color of the sea. His skin is smooth, with a very slight tinge of green on his otherwise pale skin. His face is sharp and square, with a piercing on his nose and one on his ear. His suit seems to be like a hand-me-down, it doesn’t seem to fit him that well and his sleeves look just slightly too long. He seems to be looking around the room, with two glasses of wine in his hands, as if he is looking for somebody that will look in his direction.

Jade Wheatflow: Among the crowd of people around Elcius, you see a short young woman with braided silver hair and cyan eyes. Her skin is tinged red, and she smells of tobacco and alcohol, and mixed somewhere in that smell is the perfume of gardens and flowers. She listens attentively to what Elcius is saying to the group around him, while the two dwarves by her side seem to be only half-listening, but are attentive to what she says when she does speak. 

### The treasure room

The document folder is in the treasure room. The characters should explore the manor for a bit before finding the room, each room being a room with chairs for relaxing, with varying levels of partygoers in each. One room is a dining room, with an enormous amount of food laid out for anyone to take as much as they want. Once your players get to the treasure room, you can describe the room like this: 

“As you push through another set of doors, you find yourself in a room with more partygoers in it, this one more populated than the other rooms. The walls are filled with various trophies, from stuffed animal heads to sport trophies. In the center of the room is a beautiful centerpiece: an elaborate golden sarcophagus, with 4 guards stationed around it. Several knight armor displays line the room, silently watching the party. Surrounding each one is a tall flower pot with a delicate and rare rose sitting within, visibly thriving. The back of the room features an enormous gold pile, with 2 guards on either side of it. A few partygoers are standing around it, chatting about a variety of things. You can see on each side of the room are large wooden desks, with 6 drawers on each. The top of each one has a rare dragon and wyvern skull sitting on top, along with swords and some other weapons.”

Each drawer has a chance to have the documents in them. Use a d12 to determine this, with a 12 meaning the drawer has the documents, rerolling duplicate results. If the guards around the room see the players opening the drawers, they immediately question the players, but do not attack unless the players attack first. (DM secret: only “let” the guards see if it is extremely obvious what the players are doing, otherwise just have the player roll a stealth check with advantage and the guards be distracted by something, or a loud noise come from the party, like a lot of partygoers loudly start singing lyrics) If the guards do somehow notice them, they hear a voice from their earpiece: “Play it cool, and be cooperative with them, we don’t want to cause any trouble. Lay low for an hour or so, they’ll switch shifts and forget about you, and you can try again.” All other drawers have diamonds and other shiny and expensive items.

Once the characters have obtained the documents, they hear in their earpiece, “Nice work, let’s bring that back to HQ. There’s a car for you outside, we will pick up the documents near the gas station a few miles from here.”

Optional: Only one room is locked (the one in the tower), and if your players get into the room somehow, it’s a sex dungeon, with certain “tools” lining the walls and various other appliances. DC 10 Dexterity/Sleight of Hand check to lockpick. 
### Events and mishaps to spark plot

The drawers are locked, and need to get a key for the drawers somehow. DC 15 Dexterity/Sleight of Hand check to lockpick.
- Consider putting the keyring on Elcius’ belt, but take some time to think about how the players could get these keys without drawing attention
- Keyring could also be on a guard’s belt near the drawers
- Maybe in the sex dungeon there are a lot of keys, one of which open the drawers?
- Maybe the key is hidden in one of the skulls on top?

A rival journalist doesn’t like seeing Elcius successful, and sabotages his party.
- Midway through the party, you see another half-elven man you recognize as another well-known journalist and competitor to Elcius stand up and shout, “Elcius loves to spread misinformation in his papers! Every word he says is a lie! Don’t believe anything he says!” He keeps going, shouting these things, but most of the present company ignores him after a bit and goes back to what they were doing.

A character spots a partygoer eyeing Elcius suspiciously, seemingly communicating with someone not at the party with an earpiece. (This is the spotter for the future assassin)
- “As you meander through the crowd, you notice someone out of place. She doesn’t seem to be drinking, or mingling at all. She seems to keep her eyes on Elcius, like a hawk. She also seems to be saying something to herself.” 
- High perception characters would notice that she is talking into an earpiece.

A partygoer from Ruska and one from Huma secretly have feelings for each other, and ask the character for help on asking the other one out.
- Consider this being Danore and Jade, to give them more depth. Initially, I included them just to have some NPC descriptions, but they could be useful for this. For convenience, I included descriptions of these two in the plot hook below.
- “As you make your way through the crowd, you feel a tap on your shoulder. As you turn to look at who tapped, you see a short, young half-elf standing before you. (Feel free to say the full description of Danore written above). He looks at you nervously and says, ‘Sorry to bother, but I was hoping you could help me out. You see that woman over there?’ He nervously points to a short young woman in the crowd around Elcius. (Feel free to read the full description of Jade here). ‘Her name is Jade, and she’s easy to spot because she has her skin tinged red. I was hoping you would help me admit my feelings for her. It’s not the first time I’ve seen her around at a party like this, and I’ve never seen her come in with a partner by her side, so I figure that she’s not off limits. Thing is, she’s out of my league and I’m from Ruska but she’s from Huma, and you know the whole thing between our two countries. Do you think you could help me out?’”
- If the characters help him, when they approach Jade and ask about Danore, she says, “Oh, that young man over there?” Jade gestures toward Danore, “Good news for him, I’ve had my eyes on him for a while too. Good on him for finally admitting. Bring him over if you can, I would love to get to know him.”

The characters pass by a partygoer spiking their partner’s drink.
- “As you pass by the bar, you see a couple drinking together. Someone calls out to one of them, and she looks away for a second. You see the other take something out of his pocket and put it in her drink, and quickly puts it back in his pocket. As she turns back, she doesn’t seem to notice what the man did."

One partygoer is open about their “tastes” and asks a character to acquire a “tool” from the rumored sex dungeon in Elcius’ manor. 
- “While you squeeze your way through the ocean of people, one halfling approaches you, and asks, ‘Excuse me, would you be able to help me? You see, my partner,’ he gestures to a large, muscular man behind him, ‘likes when I use certain… tools on him when we are… close. I have heard rumors that there is a room full of those certain tools in this manor, rare ones as well. Would you be able to grab one for us? It should look like a small cage. I can pay you handsomely for it.’”  

### THE TWIST

There are two twists you could choose, depending on the time you have. You could also choose both!

1: Assassin! A hooded person sneaks in through the window as they exit the treasure room, and one player notices that this person has daggers on them. As they see this happening, some people also give the mysterious person a strange look, but seeing as no one does anything, go back to their drinks and mind their own business. The hooded person then calmly walks out of the room into the main hall area. 

They hear in their earpiece, “We have eyes on a strange person that entered into the mansion through a window, do you confirm?” If the player follows the hooded person, they see the person walking straight toward Elcius. The players then hear in their earpiece, “Holy shit, that guy wants to kill someone! Subdue him! Distract him or something! We can’t have any bloodshed tonight!”

As long as the players don’t kill the assassin or let the assassin kill anyone, then they hear in their earpiece, “That was a close one, well done on handling that! We will add a bonus to your pay for handling that unexpected event.”

2: Danse Macabre! (NOTE: this twist does not fit well with the plot, but if you find your players are not too interested in the plot then this could be a way to grab their attention). At some point early on in the party, a partygoer next to them who seems fairly young, no older than 20, asks a character, “Do you find it strange how everyone talks like it’s 30 years ago? They don’t seem to understand modern slang either, how strange.” A while later, at exactly midnight (or, if you also use the assassin twist, then this is once the assassin reaches Elcius), the players hear a bell chime midnight, and the music suddenly changes tune, to a much slower, much creepier melody. At this moment, Elcius clinks his glass to get the attention of the party, and the entire manor falls silent. With the manor quiet, you can hear his voice with ease, and he begins speaking to the whole attendance: “I would like to thank you all for attending, you are all wonderful guests. As you know, the clock has just struck midnight, which means the party is just getting started! With that being said, let the REAL party begin!” As he says this, the lights dim a little, and a chill fills the air. He raises his hands toward the skylight, and the moonlight that was filtering in turns blood red, as the moon becomes a blood moon. Suddenly, Elcius erupts into laughter, joined in by the rest of the party, and you see as the skin and muscle on his body fades and falls away, leaving only a skeleton with a wizard robe, arms still upraised, but his eyes are replaced by green glowing orbs. The laughter around you grows louder, as the same happens to most of the partygoers around you, skin and muscles fading and falling to reveal the skeletal form underneath, some only partially fading to become zombies. The two women latched onto Elcius slowly form into different beings, skin turning pale white, hair becoming frazzled and sticking out farther, teeth becoming sharper and longer, as they become banshees. You hear your earpiece start to become static, as the connection becomes weaker, “What (static) going on (static) do you copy (static) the hell? (static)” Finally, as the party becomes this undead army, you see a few normal humans as well, frozen in fear. Elcius, in his new form, says “Shall we welcome our new guests to the eternal party?” The mass of undead charge at one of the poor human souls across the party from you, ignoring you for now. It seems you only have a few seconds before you are the horde’s next victim. What do you do?


### Chase scene

This optional chase scene occurs after the characters have stolen the documents back. It uses the chase rules found in the DMG [[https://anyflip.com/fsfu/qjsj](https://anyflip.com/fsfu/qjsj) pg. 252] and the vehicle rules found in Descent into Avernus [[https://anyflip.com/uggd/evkp](https://anyflip.com/uggd/evkp) pg. 219] (both included below). 

“As you leave the party behind, you begin to hear the sounds of shouting and confusion behind you, fading into the night. As you approach the getaway car, you hear Elcius from the doors of the manor shout, ‘There they are! Get them!’ You see four guards run towards their motorbikes, and Elcius and another guard run toward their own car. What do you do?”
