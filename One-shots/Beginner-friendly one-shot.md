General plot and player knowledge before beginning:
- Someone has robbed a local tavern of 20gp, leaving few suspects and a dead barman (Corum), which are a Dragonborn named Harold, the ex-leader of a local theive’s guild named Gerald, and the pack of kobolds about a mile outside town. It’s up to you and your companions to figure out who was the cause of this and put a stop to them.

Some information about the crime:
- The murder most likely took place around midnight, and there were obvious signs of struggle. Blood spots on the floor indicated some sort of battle took place, mostly human blood. Chairs and tables alike were flipped over, along with scratch marks along the walls.

Reasons why Harold is a suspect:
- Red scales were found at the crime scene, along with large claw marks left along the sides of the wall. The barman once had to kick Harold out of the tavern for being too rowdy, which sort of left Harold in a bad mood. Harold was also the last to leave the bar the night the crime took place.

Reasons why Harold did not do the crime:
- The grudge Harold had against the barman has long since dissipated, and many friends of Harold say that Harold had rekindled his friendship with Corum since then.

Reasons why Gerald is a suspect:
- Since Gerald was once a crime leader, and has plenty of experience in crimes because of that, many people say that Gerald has returned to his life of crime. Many people also say that he had professionally pinned the crime on someone else.
Reasons why Gerald did not do the crime:
- There is no viable reason for Gerald to have done this. Gerald is in the elderly stage of his life, and has already served his punishment for the crimes he did in his criminal days. Gerald was good friends with Corum, and went to the tavern every day. He has not touched crime since his days in the theive’s guild, which was 10 years ago.

Reasons why the kobolds did this:
- They want treasure. They are kobolds. They are chaos. 
When the players show up to the kobolds, they can see the dead body of Corum and the 20 gold that was stolen, but then a kobold on guard duty sees them and engages them, along with some of the kobold gang.
