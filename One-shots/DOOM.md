The players need to find a way to stop the Avatar of Fire, Yaga Shura, from taking over the material plane. But it’s not that simple, they also need to bring an army with them to hold off the forces of the nine hells. 

give your players a magic item of a decent rarity, they are level 20 after all!

Player knowledge before the session: As level 20 adventurers, most things do not come as a surprise, you’ve fought giant worms, mind flayers, and even a terrifyingly strong rat. But as you sit around this meeting table with the leaders of many different areas, what one of them says sends a shiver down your spine. After all, all-powerful devils like to stay in hell… right?

The players start sitting around a round meeting table, with a large space in the middle for someone to speak. Many leaders of other regions sit and wait patiently for the elven man standing in the middle to explain why he called this meeting a week ago. He appears to have a terrified look on his elven face, and his hands are shaking in terror. Shakily, he says, “As this is an urgent matter, I see no reason to prolong this with introductions besides my name: Kolth. I received word around a week ago that an archdevil by the name of Yaga Shura has found a way to amass an army from the Nine Hells onto the material plane. As we all know, there is only one reason for an archdevil to do such a thing: to utterly destroy the material plane and claim all the souls from it and bind them to the Nine Hells.” He then looks at you all and says, “That is why I have invited you here, with your adventuring and fighting experience, you are our best hope to protect the material planes. To assist you, I will be supplying my army, and I implore the rest of you to supply yours as well. The fate of our realms depends on it.” You watch as the leaders sitting around the table go around and each pledge to send their armies to assist you. When the last one finishes, Kolth, still standing in the center, speaks up again: “Should everything go right, the armies we send should hold off the army of the Nine Hells long enough for you to defeat Yaga. If my intel is correct, he will arrive in one week at the Ravine of Fire. With his defeat, his army should give up and retreat. Any questions?”

-> A common question that could come out of this is how did Kolth get his information. He explains: “A mercenary group uncovered a cult following that was trying to help Yaga take over. One of the cultists admitted to everything.”

-> Once the players are satisfied with their questions/answers, Kolth dismisses the meeting. At this point, ask if the players would like to do anything in the week before the meeting. There is not much I can do to guide this, but do include some influence with Magi-Tech things as you see fit, as it will help lead up to the final battle.

If you need some basis to work off of, here is a sort of template of a world you can use:
- One region mostly consists of fishing towns, represented by a halfling named Greg
- Another region consists entirely of sky cities, floating islands and stuff, represented by a high elf named Lucy
- A region settled nearby a now-dormant volcano, represented by a dragonborn named Harold
- A coastal region mostly made up of tourist cities, represented by a gnome named Eric
- A mountain region with a sparse population, represented by a dwarf named Snarf
- An archipelago region made up mostly of amphibious folk, represented by a grung named Grung

The Final Battle

As you all meet back up at the Ravine of Fire, you carefully watch the other side of the ravine (about 400 feet wide) with Kolth beside you. After a couple minutes, you see a portal open on the other side, a red flickering ring around it with a dark void in the middle. The dark void shimmers, and you see a giant covered in fire step out, wearing large pieces of armor, with his muscles rippling between each piece. His hair flickers with flames, his beard seemingly licking downward. His red skin almost seems to warm you even from this distance. Kolth brings out a sending stone, and says “Yaga is here, it’s time” into it. Around you, more portals appear, with blue rings around them, with a similar black void. From these, you can see a mass of armored men and women, with occasional colossal robots stepping from the portals, accompanied by ships with massive guns.

(if the players met any leaders, describe those leaders appearing from the portals as well)

As that is happening, you see portals open on the other side of the ravine, with a red ring around them and a black void in the middle. Out of these, you see hundreds, thousands, millions of demons pouring out of them. You see other demons, such as bearded devils, with small sharp maces acting as their beards, wielding spears. You see bone devils, appearing almost skeletal, but with pale white skin, rows of sharp, long teeth, eyes filled with hatred. Some wield a long tail with a sharp hook at the end, dripping with poison. You see horned devils, with large leathery wings, curled horns, and a tail that whips back and forth, wielding a double-pronged fork, glowing with heat at the ends. You even see a few pit fiends, with crimson red skin, wings, and horns, muscles rippling down their body, wielding a large mace. Yaga Shura, in a loud, deep, booming voice, yells out, “The Avatar of Fire is here to cleanse your sad little mortal world.” He then brings out a hilt of a sword, then points it toward you. You see fire leap out from the hilt, forming a sword at least as tall as you are. As he does so, you feel the earth beneath you start to rumble, and you see the two sides of the ravine close in on each other rapidly. You manage to catch yourself, and notice that Yaga has brought the two ends of the ravine together. He then points his fiery sword toward the sky, and a transparent red dome appears around you and Yaga, separating you and him from the rest of the army, who all charge at each other. Roll initiative.
