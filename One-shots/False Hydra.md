This one shot is based on the False Hydra ([http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2014/09/false-hydra.html](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2014/09/false-hydra.html)) (probably don’t tell your players this)

Player knowledge before game begins:

Strange things like people being erased from existence, animals randomly freaking out, and strange sightings repeatedly occurring have been reported in Ardyh, and you, along with your group, have been tasked with finding out what is causing this. 

Game begins

(give your players a chance to introduce themselves as well during or before this part)

With the sun on the horizon, sending a beautiful golden haze over the calm afternoon air, you see your target city on the horizon: Ardyh. You are accompanied by Eslaf, who chose to assist you on this mission, and as the gates of Ardyh approach, he points to them and says, “There it is, the city of mysteries.” As you approach, is there anything you would like to do?

Walking down the streets of Ardyh, you see a few people walking around this late in the afternoon, but not many. You see a tavern on the right, with a sign hanging over it with the words “Tegrof’s Tavern” engraved on it. You can hear the faint sounds of murmuring conversations coming from it, and the smell of food almost seems to calm your senses. On the left, you see a row of shops, most of which appear to be closed down. Beyond that, you also see rows of houses leading up to a grander-looking house, and even from this distance you can see the doors are extravagant and the windows are shrouded by fancy curtains. Not far from the grand house, you can see the top of the roof of what appears to be a town hall.

The people of Ardyh have no memory of the mayor, and are unsure as to why there is a house for a mayor.

The tavern is always open, and it only has two employees, Tegrof, and his wife, Eno. If the players tell either that they are here on a mission because of strange reports, then Tegrof goes to get them some dinner, and Eno sets them up with a room for the night. At some point, Eno or Tegrof should mention being married for over 30 years. Have Eslaf stay a bit longer downstairs to eat his dinner and have a few drinks before going with the players to turn in for the night. Once the players head up to their room: After a couple minutes, Eslaf enters the room. He says, “Man, Tegrof and Eno sure do seem like a happy couple. If I was half as lucky as they are I would still be a very happy man.”

After the players take a long rest: You wake up in the morning feeling refreshed, the sun shining through the windows. Then you notice a bag that you don’t recognize. If the players open or otherwise inspect the bag: It seems to have belonged to a person named Eslaf, but that name doesn’t ring any bells in their heads. In fact, you’ve never met an Eslaf in your life. You also find a note that says “HELP IT’S EATING ME.”

Should players try to go into the closed shops, roll a d20. On a 1-15, the shop is permanently closed down and is filled with dust. These shops are easy to break into. On a 16-20, the shop is closed down for the night, and if players wish to enter, have them roll to see if they break in (DC 15 for Athletics, DC 10 for picking the lock). If it is morning, no check is required, the shop is open, unless it is abandoned.
- Empty shops: As the door gives way, the smell of dust immediately fills your nose, and as the dust settles, you see what used to be a shop. It appears that no one has been in here for a long time, and a layer of dust covers everything. The floor creaks beneath your feet, partially muted by the dust on the ground. 
- Other shops: You open the door into a small shop, and it appears to be well-kept, the floors and counter are clean, along with the items inside.
If the players attempt to go into a house, roll a d20. On a 1-15, the house is abandoned, and is similar to the abandoned shops. On a 16-20, the house is locked and occupied.
- If the players wander the houses in the streets for a bit: You wander through the houses, looking for any clues as to what is going on in Ardyh (you can have the player roll investigation if you like) and you don’t find much. One thing catches your eye, however. These houses all have names on them. And one of them has your name on it.
- If the players go in this house, the player with their name on it sees things that they think they should remember, but don’t. They also see a portrait of them with what appears to be their parents, and a younger version of them. They have no memory of the other people in the portrait.

If the players attempt to go into the grand house (the mayor’s house): You approach the extravagant doors, and surprisingly, they easily open. You enter a grand room, with a chandelier hanging from the ceiling. Two staircases on either side of the room lead up to a second floor. The hardwood floor beneath your feet is covered in at least a half inch of dust, and your feet make a soft thump as you walk across the floor. The entire house is deathly silent.
- All the rooms of this house are covered in dust. The master bedroom has a painting over the bed that depicts a man, a woman, and a baby. Another room has a crib in it, with children’s toys scattered around it. The kitchen smells of rotten food, and of course is filled with it.

The church only has one person occupying it; the priest, Jack. Jack has gone crazy in the last month or so, his ears are plugged, he constantly is holding a hand mirror, and he goes on and on about how the whole town is doomed because of the “memory monster”. He won’t offer much useful information, but if the players ask where they can find information about the town he would direct them to the town hall. Play Jack as the “town crazy”

After a bit of wandering in the town: After wandering the town for a bit, you pass by a few commoners on their way home from work, but then, you suddenly realize that you feel as if you are being watched. Closely. Very closely. By something… inhuman. After a few seconds, the feeling disappears as quickly as it appeared. 

Another thing that can happen as they wander through town: You see a cat sleeping next to a house, when suddenly it stands up, arches its back, tail straight up, seemingly seeing something by another house, and dashes off as fast as it can. 


The town hall is locked until the morning. If they decide to break in, DC 20 Athletics or DC 17 with theive’s tools, and if they do get in, no one is inside. In the morning, the door is unlocked and the receptionist (Mitciv) is at the desk. If the receptionist is at the desk: You see a middle aged woman at the desk, and as you approach, she peers over the rim of her glasses at you and says, “yes?” Mitciv would then direct the players to whatever they would need, within reason.

In the town hall, there is a library (well rolled Investigation checks can tell the PCs about the False Hydra in books they may find, things like the effect of the song it sings, using mirrors to see it, the degree of separation mechanic, things like that), a hall that as you walk down goes through the history of Ardyh (pretty stereotypical city, mostly shows different mayors being sworn into office, the city being built, etc) but in the last photo (the one that is most recent): As you look at this photo you can’t help but feel that something about it is off, something isn’t being included in the photo that was there when it was taken… 

There are other things in the town hall that would be kept here, like a census and things like that, but the main thing here is that once the PCs realize the thing affecting this town is a False Hydra, when they return to the receptionist, she is gone. If the players use a mirror to look at where she was, they see a blood stain, and a number of False Hydra heads staring back at them through the mirror, blood dripping from it’s maw. They also see many holes that appear to be where the Hydra broke through the floors, walls, and ceilings. Looking at those spots normally, however, reveal no Hydra and no holes, as if the Hydra does not exist.


The final fight

OK I’m not gonna lie here, this fight is extremely hard to balance, mostly because of the amount of heads it has, so be prepared to make changes on the fly. Despite this, start with this stat block. 

Things to know before running this fight: how many heads will it have? Should it get one attack per head? I recommend having an amount of heads equal to half the number of PCs + 1, rounded down, but this would depend on what level your PCs are. I think you should keep them below level 9 so that its attacks are impactful and actually present a danger. Level 7 or 8 should be a good sweet spot. 3 Players - 2 heads, 4 players - 3 heads, 5 players - 3 heads, 6 players, 4 heads, etc.

Blind Song All hostile creatures that can hear the Hydra sing must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the start of their turn. If the Hydra sings with more than one head, all hostile creatures must subtract 1d4 from their saving throw. On a failure, the creature forgets the Hydra is there.
  

ACTIONS

Multiattack. The Hydra can use a claw attack and a bite attack on its turn.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10+3) piercing damage. 

Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8+3) slashing damage. If the Hydra succeeds on a claw attack, it can choose to grapple the target instead of dealing damage. (The hydra can only grapple one creature at a time and cannot use its claw attack while grappling a creature.)
  

BONUS ACTIONS

Sing. The Hydra can use a bonus action to stop singing or to start its song with an additional head.

Regrowth. The Hydra can use a bonus action to begin regrowing a head that has died. It takes three Regrowth bonus actions to fully regrow a head. It regains 20 hit points each time it uses Regrowth.


REACTIONS

Multireact. The Hydra can make two reactions per round as long as it has three or more heads.

Wail. After taking damage, the Hydra can use a reaction to wail. Creatures within 5ft of the Hydra when it wails take 2d4 psychic damage. (I would recommend a Wisdom save for this, optional)

  

Physically, the false hydra resembles a “mundane” hydra in a superficial way but is a creature altogether far more disquieting and sinister. It has pallid nearly white skin, and while it has multiple long-necked heads like a hydra, each head is uncannily humanoid in shape with savage teeth and blackened pits in place of eyes. It prefers to spend its time mostly underground, so the first and often only time it is observed is as a single white humanoid head snaking up from the ground and dragging its victim underground to be devoured.
